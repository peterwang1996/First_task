			A puppy is a juvenile dog. Some puppies can weigh 1–3 lb (0.45–1.36 kg), while larger ones can weigh up to 15–23 lb (6.8–10.4 kg). All healthy puppies grow quickly after birth. A puppy's coat color may change as the puppy grows older, as is commonly seen in breeds such as the <strong>Yorkshire Terrier</strong> .<br/> In vernacular English, puppy refers specifically to dogs while pup may often be used for other mammals such as seals, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giraffe">giraffes</a>, guinea pigs, or even rats.br

			Born after an average of 63 days of gestation, puppies emerge in an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amnion">amnion</a> that is bitten off and eaten by the mother dog.[1] <strong>Puppies begin to nurse almost immediately</strong>. If the litter exceeds six puppies, particularly if one or more are obvious runts, human intervention in hand-feeding the stronger puppies is necessary to ensure that the runts get proper nourishment and attention from the mother.<br/> As they reach one month of age, puppies are gradually weaned and begin to eat solid food. The mother may regurgitate partially digested food for the puppies or might let them eat some of her solid food.[2] The mother dog usually refuses to nurse at this stage, though she might let them occasionally nurse for comfort.

			The practice of docking began primarily as a <strong>reventive measure</strong>p for injury among working dogs. Docking is now primarily performed for purely cosmetic reasons, and some breeds traditionally have their tails cropped anywhere from slightly to almost entirely.[6] <br/>Many countries now ban cropping and docking for cosmetic purposes, like Australia, parts of Canada, the majority of the European countries (Austria, Greece, Finland, Netherlands, Italy, Czech Republic, Turkey, Poland, Slovakia, England, Scotland, Slovenia, Ireland, Norway and Sweden), while others, such as the United States, permit it. The practice is currently opposed by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Veterinary_Medical_Association">American Veterinary Medical Association</a> .[7] <br/>Some breeders also prefer to declaw the dogs to prevent future injuries caused by scratching, or in the case of dewclaws, ingrown and ripped off nails. Docking and declawing procedures are usually performed within the first few days after birth, by a veterinarian, or by an experienced breeder.
